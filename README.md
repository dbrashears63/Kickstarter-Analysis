## Analysis of Play Campaigns

### Background Information

The task was to find what factors would contribute to a successful campaign. A sample set of Kickstarter data was used to determine these factors. Since the funding goal was nearly reached in a short time span, we will look at launch dates and funding goals to help determine the optimal funding goals and launch dates to create a successful play launch.

### Launch Dates

It was determined the first set of date to look at will be launch dates and whether the play was a success, failure, or was cancelled. This will show the correlation between the launch date and whether the play was a success, failure, or was cancelled. By creating a graph called Theater Outcomes by Launch Date this will immediately show what month or months had the best success. 

#### Results

In a review of the data, it was determined that the most successful plays were launched in the month of May. In addition, the month leading and following May were also successful, but slightly less so. Most failed plays were launch in the months of January, March, September, and in November.
