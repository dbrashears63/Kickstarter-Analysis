# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Purpose 

The playwright for the play Fever nearly reached its Kickstarter goal in a short amount of time. Ultimately the campaign was unsuccessful. This report will present an analysis to help determine what factors will contribute to a successful Kickstarter campaign for the play.

## Analysis of Play Campaigns

### Background Information

The task was to find what factors would contribute to a successful campaign. A sample set of Kickstarter data was used to determine these factors. Since the funding goal was nearly reached in a short time span, we will look at launch dates and funding goals to help determine the optimal funding goals and launch dates to create a successful play launch.

### Launch Dates

It was determined the first set of date to look at will be launch dates and whether the play was a success, failure, or was cancelled. This will show the correlation between the launch date and whether the play was a success, failure, or was cancelled. By creating a graph called Theater Outcomes by Launch Date this will immediately show what month or months had the best success. 

#### Results

In a review of the data, it was determined that the most successful plays were launched in the month of May. In addition, the month leading and following May were also successful, but slightly less so. Most failed plays were launch in the months of January, March, September, and in November.

### Funding Goals

The next set of data used was the funding goals and what percentage of plays were a success, failure, or cancelled based on the set funding goals. This will show the correlation between funding goals and whether the play was a success, failure, or was cancelled. By creating a graph called Outcomes Based on Goals. This will immediately show what percentage of funding goals were a success, failure, or cancelled.

#### Results 

In a review of the data, it was determined that the most successful funding goal asked for less than $5000 with an average success rate of 74%. Also, campaigns asking for between $35,000 â€“ $44,999 where fully funded had a success rate of 67%.
